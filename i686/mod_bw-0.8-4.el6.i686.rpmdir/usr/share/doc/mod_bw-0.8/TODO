Todo :

  - Fixing MaxConnections behaviour
  - Limiting on INPUT
  - Per User Bandwidth
  - Fix symbols on some distros
  - Htaccess support

 All this will be included before the release of v1.0
 After reaching v1.0, the full code of the mod will be rewritten, 
and will include some new features, leaving v1.0 of the mod, as 
legacy code.
